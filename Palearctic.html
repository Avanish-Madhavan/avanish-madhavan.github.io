        <p>Understanding the impact of climate change in Palearctic</p>
    </header>
    <h2>Species Affected</h2>
        <div class="data-point">
            Wildlife like the red fox and Arctic fox are struggling as their habitats shift and food availability changes. In Europe, about 24% of bumblebee species are threatened, facing declines due to habitat destruction and agricultural practices. The red-crowned crane, for instance, faces habitat loss as its breeding range shifts northward due to rising temperatures and changing environmental conditions.

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Palearctic region, the second largest of the eight biogeographic realms on Earth, encompasses Europe,
            North Africa, and most of Asia north of the Himalayas. Its climate history, especially in terms of carbon
            dioxide (CO₂) levels, reflects global climatic trends influenced by geological epochs and human activities.

        <h2>Periods</h2>
        <div class="data-point">
            <b>Pleistocene Epoch (~2.6 million to ~11,700 years ago):</b> <br>The Pleistocene was characterised by
            repeated glaciations and interglacial periods, with global temperatures fluctuating. The Palearctic,
            particularly Europe and northern Asia, experienced extensive ice cover during glacial maxima. CO₂ levels
            during glaciations were low, around 180-200 ppm (parts per million), contributing to cooler global
            temperatures. During interglacial periods, such as the Eemian (~130,000-115,000 years ago), CO₂ levels rose
            to around 280-300 ppm, leading to warmer conditions and the retreat of ice sheets.
            <br>
        </div>
        <div class="data-point">
            <b>Holocene Epoch (~11,700 years ago to present):</b> <br>Following the last glacial maximum (~20,000 years
            ago), CO₂ levels began to increase. The Holocene is characterised by relatively stable climate conditions
            compared to the Pleistocene, allowing human civilizations to develop. CO₂ concentrations rose from ~260 ppm
            at the beginning of the Holocene to about 280-300 ppm before the industrial revolution.
            <br>
        </div>
        <div class="data-point">
            <b>Industrial Era (1750-present):</b> <br>The Palearctic region, especially Europe, became a major
            contributor to the rise in atmospheric CO₂ due to industrialization, fossil fuel use, and deforestation. By
            the early 20th century, CO₂ levels had risen to ~300 ppm. In recent decades, due to human activities, global
            CO₂ levels have surpassed 400 ppm. This increase in CO₂ has contributed to global warming, impacting the
            Palearctic climate with warmer temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and more extreme weather
            events.
            <br>
        </div>
        <div class="data-point">
            <b>Current and Future Trends:</b> <br>The Palearctic is experiencing notable climate changes due to
            increased
            greenhouse gas emissions. These include warmer winters, earlier springs, shrinking snow and ice cover in
            northern regions, and shifts in ecosystems. If current trends continue, CO₂ levels could rise to over 500
            ppm by 2100, leading to further warming and significant ecological and societal impacts across the
            region.<br><br>
            In summary, the Palearctic region's climate has been shaped by glacial-interglacial cycles and, more
            recently, by human-driven CO₂ emissions. The steady rise in CO₂ levels, particularly over the last two
            centuries, has contributed to the current climate crisis affecting the region and the world.

        <h2>Effects of Climate Change</h2>
        <div class="data-point">
            <b>Melting of Glaciers:</b> <br>The Palearctic region, situated in the extreme north, is home to numerous
            glaciers that are essential for regulating global temperature. However, rising global temperatures due to
            greenhouse gas emissions are causing these glaciers to melt at alarming rates. This reduces their size and
            disrupts local ecosystems reliant on cold temperatures. Changes in glacial meltwater patterns affect
            freshwater supplies for both humans and wildlife, particularly in regions like the Alps and the Ural
            Mountains.
            <br>
        </div>
        <div class="data-point">
            <b>Rising of sea level:</b> <br>The melting glaciers contribute significantly to global sea-level rise,
            which poses serious risks to coastal areas worldwide. As glaciers and ice sheets melt, sea levels rise,
            increasing the frequency of flooding, storm surges, and coastal erosion. Coastal cities around the
            Mediterranean are especially vulnerable to these changes, which may also lead to more severe weather events,
            such as tsunamis.
            <br>
        </div>
        <div class="data-point">
            <b>Loss of Habitat:</b> <br>The retreat of glaciers and sea ice results in significant habitat loss for
            Arctic species like polar bears and walruses, which rely on sea ice for hunting and breeding. As the ice
            diminishes, these animals must travel further for food, leading to starvation and decreased reproductive
            success. This loss not only affects individual species but also disrupts broader ecosystems, threatening
            biodiversity in the region.
