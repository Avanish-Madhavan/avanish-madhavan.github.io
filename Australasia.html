    <h2>Species Affected</h2>
        <div class="data-point">
            The Green Sea Turtle faces extreme gender imbalances, as warming sands lead to a predominantly female hatchling population. The Carnaby's Black Cockatoo is increasingly vulnerable to heat stress, exacerbated by more frequent heatwaves, while the Mountain Pygmy-possum suffers from habitat loss and food resource depletion.

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Climate change poses a significant challenge to Australasia, particularly Australia, which has been
            experiencing marked changes in temperature, rainfall patterns, and extreme weather events. This overview
            integrates findings from NASA and other authoritative sources to highlight the current state of climate
            change in the region.</p>

        <h2>Insights</h2>
        <div class="data-point">
            <b>Warming Rates:</b> <br>Australia's average land and sea temperatures have increased by approximately
            1.44°C since 1910, with every decade since 1950 being warmer than the last. The warmest year recorded was
            2019, with temperatures 1.52°C above average.
            <br>
        </div>
        <div class="data-point">
            <b>Future Projections:</b> <br>By 2030, temperatures are expected to rise by an additional 0.4 to 2.0°C, and
            by 2070, they could increase by 1 to 6°C above 1990 levels.
            <br>
        </div>
        <div class="data-point">
            <b>Decreased Rainfall:</b> <br>Southern Australia has seen a 10-20% decrease in rainfall during cooler
            months since the 1970s, while northern regions have experienced increases.
            <br>
        </div>
        <div class="data-point">
            <b>Heavy Rainfall Events:</b> <br>Intensity of heavy rainfall events has increased by over 10% since 1979,
            leading to more severe flooding risks.
            <br>
        </div>
        <div class="data-point">
            <b>Sea Level Rises:</b> <br>Australia's coastlines are vulnerable to rising sea levels, which are projected
            to increase between 8 to 88 cm globally. Coastal areas in Australia are already experiencing erosion and
            inundation risks, particularly affecting densely populated regions.
            <br>
        </div>
        <div class="data-point">
            <b>Collaborative Efforts and Research:</b> <br>NASA collaborates with the Australian Space Agency to enhance
            Earth observation capabilities, focusing on climate monitoring. Their joint efforts aim to improve data
            accuracy regarding climate changes through advanced satellite missions such as NASA's Climate Absolute
            Radiance and Refractivity Observatory Pathfinder (CLARREO-PF) and Australia's Satellite Cross-Calibration
            Radiometer (SCR).
            <br>
        </div>
        <div class="data-point">
            <b>Bushfires:</b> <br>The frequency and intensity of bushfires have escalated due to higher temperatures and
            increased storm activity, particularly in southern Australia.
            <br>
        </div>
        <div class="data-point">
            <b>Heatwaves:</b> <br>The duration and intensity of heatwaves have risen significantly since 1970, with hot
            weather records occurring three times more often than cold records in recent years.

        <h2>Carbon Dioxide Levels</h2>
        <div class="chart" id="climate-graph">
            <p style="color: #ccc;">
                <b>Pre-Industrial Era (260-280 ppm):</b> Carbon levels were stable due to natural processes
                like volcanic activity and the carbon cycle, with forests and oceans as major carbon sinks.<br><br>
                <b>Industrial Era (1750-1900, 280-300 ppm):</b> CO₂ levels rose gradually due to deforestation and land use
                changes, especially in Australia for agriculture.<br><br>
                <b>20th Century (300-370 ppm):</b> CO₂ levels rose rapidly with fossil fuel combustion, urbanisation, and
                agriculture, including methane and CO₂ emissions from New Zealand's pastoral farming.<br><br>
                <b>Modern Era (2000-present, 400+ ppm):</b> Carbon levels have exceeded 400 ppm, causing frequent droughts,
                heatwaves, and shifts in rainfall patterns across Australasia.<br><br>
                <b>Future Trends (~500 ppm by 2100):</b> If emissions continue, CO₂ could reach 500 ppm, worsening climate
                challenges such as biodiversity loss, extreme weather, and water scarcity.
