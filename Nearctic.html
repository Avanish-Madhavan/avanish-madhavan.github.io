    <h2>Species Affected</h2>
        <div class="data-point">
            Polar bear population declines in Alaska and Canada, and extirpations of Bay checkerspot butterfly populations in the San Francisco Bay area are just two examples of how climate change is harming wildlife. There are currently an estimated 1,300 endangered or threatened animal species in North America alone, whose numbers have been severely affected by human activity.

        <h2>Total CO<sub>2</sub></h2>
        <p>Energy is responsible for the majority of climate change-causing greenhouse gas emissions, mostly from the
            burning of fossil fuels. Despite efforts to reduce these emissions, the trajectory of CO<sub>2</sub>
            emissions globally
            remains far higher than what is needed to avoid the worst effects of climate change.<br><br>
            Note that numbers shown below refer to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fuel combustion in the energy sector.
            They do not
            include other important sources of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions such as methane leaks from oil
            and gas operations, which are more difficult to measure. The <a style="color: aqua;"

                Gas Emissions from Energy Data</a>
            Explorer has more complete estimates for most countries and regions.<br><br>
            Per-capita energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions tend to be higher in more economically-developed regions,
            but can
            also vary greatly depending on the structure of the economy and the energy system. For example, per-capita
            emissions will be higher in economies that rely more on carbon-intensive modes of transportation (like
            driving and flying), have a higher share of energy-intensive industries (like steel or chemicals) or depend
            heavily on fossil fuels for power generation. [Source: IEA]

        <div class="data-point">
            In the United States alone, the temperature increases across 48 contiguous by 0.17℉ every decade. Average
            temperatures have risen more quickly since the late 1970s (0.32 to 0.51℉ since 1979. [Source:USEPA]

        <div class="data-point">
            From 1948 to 2016, the average temperature in Canada increased by 1.7℃, and by 2.3℃ in north Canada alone,
            which is about triple the global rate. [Source: Gouvernement du Canada]

        <div class="data-point">
            During 1991–2019 there was significant overall warming of ~4.4°C in winter, ~2.7°C in spring, and ~1.7°C in
            summer that was generally focused in areas away from the extreme south. The strongest warming was in west
            and northwest Greenland, up to ~6–6.5°C in winter. [Source: Climate Change Knowledge Portal]

        <h2>Precipitation</h2>
        <p>Precipitation in the contiguous 48 states of the US has increased at a rate of 0.18 inches per decade. Some
            parts of the United States have experienced greater increases in precipitation than others. A few areas,
            such as the Southwest, have seen a decrease in precipitation. [Source: USEPA]<br><br>
            From 1948 to 2014, the seasonal average precipitation departures for Canada have shown an overall upward
            progression for each of the four seasons. All seasons tended to be wetter than the corresponding 1961-1990
            reference value from the mid-1970s onward. [Source: Gouvernement du Canada]<br><br>
            Liquid precipitation over GIC in Greenland has increased by 2–3 mm w.e./decade in the period
            1990–2010. [Source: Frontiers]
