    <h2>Species Affected</h2>
        <div class="data-point">
            The fauna of Amazon forest, including snakes and other reptiles. The Sira Curassow and Southern Helmeted Curassow, both critically endangered birds, face dwindling populations of 50–249 and 1,000–4,999 individuals, respectively, primarily due to deforestation and climate impacts.

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Neotropical Region consists of South America, Central America, and the Caribbean. It's known for its rich
            biodiversity, dense tropical rainforests and complex climate systems.<br><br>
            As of 2023, the average atmospheric CO₂ concentration globally is approximately 420 parts per million (ppm),
            but this varies significantly across different regions. In the Neotropic region, especially within the
            Amazon rainforest, carbon dynamics are especially critical.<br><br>
            Between 1990 and 2000, the CO2 concentration in the Neotropic region was more than 35% while the total
            increase in the world's emission (excluding land use change) was almost 13%. In South America the increase
            came mainly from industry and transport, where emissions increased by more than 40% between 1990 and 1999.
            The increase in emissions from electricity and heat production was more than 70%, but these emissions are
            still lower than emissions from transport and industry.

        <h2>Amazon rainforest - “The Lungs of The World.”</h2>
        <div class="data-point">
            The Amazon rainforest covers approximately 5.5 million square kilometres and is a critical buffer against
            the increase in CO2 concentrations worldwide. It absorbs approximately 2.2 billion metric tons of carbon
            dioxide from the atmosphere each year. It is estimated to contain about 123 billion tons of carbon above and
            below ground and is one of Earth's most important terrestrial carbon reserves.
        </div>
        <div class="data-point">
            The rainforest removes more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it emits, reducing global warming. The
            Amazon's carbon balance is a matter of life and death: living trees take carbon dioxide out of the air as
            they grow, and dead trees put the greenhouse gas back into the air as they decompose.
        </div>
        <div class="data-point">
            However, recent research indicates that the carbon sink capacity of the Amazon is weakening due to climate
            change, deforestation, and degradation. According to the World Resources Institute, Brazil alone lost over
            9,000 square kilometres of forest in 2020, contributing to increased CO2 emissions. A study published in
            2022 suggested that parts of the Amazon may have transitioned from being a carbon sink to a carbon source,
            particularly in areas experiencing severe deforestation. For instance, the eastern Amazon has experienced
            significant forest loss, leading to increased emissions. Deforestation rates reached 13,000 square
            kilometres in 2020, highlighting the pressure on this vital ecosystem.

        <h2>Effects of Climate Change:</h2>
        <p>The impact of CO2 concentration on climate change is profound. Studies indicate that regions with high levels
            of deforestation experience a decrease in rainfall and an increase in temperature, further increasing carbon
            release from the soil and vegetation.<br><br>
            The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that if current trends continue, the Neotropic
            region could be among the worst affected and could see a temperature increase of up to 2.5°C by 2050,
            affecting the ability to store carbon. Being home to the largest rainforest in the world, the effect on the
            biodiversity and the ecosystems would be vast as many species are at risk.

        <h2>Annual deforestation in the Amazon and resulting CO2 emissions:</h2>
        <div class="data-point">
            According to the World Resources Institute, Brazil had the highest carbon dioxide equivalent emissions in
            the Amazon in 2001, primarily due to changes in land use. Most of the region's forests are in South America,
            particularly in Brazil and Peru, which comprise 92% of the total forest cover. These countries are among the
            10 that hold two-thirds of the world's forests and jungles. Because of its size, the greatest extent of
            deforestation is in Brazil, but the deforestation rates are higher in Mexico and Argentina.
        </div>
        <div class="data-point">
            While the deforestation rate in Brazil in the 1990s was 0.4%, the rate in Mexico and Argentina was 1.1% and
            0.8%, respectively. Tree-felling in the Brazilian Amazon basin during the 2000's decade increased by 32%,
            from 14,000 to 18,000 square kilometres per year.
        </div>
        <div class="data-point">
            The major sources of pressure in the forests include the expansion of farming and livestock activities and
            urban spread, which force a re-conversion of the land.
