    <h2>Species Affected</h2>
        <div class="data-point">
            African apes, including gorillas and chimpanzees, risk losing up to 85% of their habitats by 2050 due to rising temperatures. Additionally, elephants and other savanna wildlife face food scarcity and habitat changes.

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The NASA-led project, based on data from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), provides a comprehensive
            look at carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions across more than 100 countries. The research measures both the
            emission of CO₂ and the amount absorbed by <b>"sinks"</b> like forests. The study highlights the role of
            <b>deforestation</b>, especially in the <b>Global South</b> (which includes parts of Africa), as a
            significant contributor to total carbon emissions. It also emphasises how top-down methods, using data from
            satellites and surface-based networks, can offer insights into how emissions are changing over time.
            Natural and human-made CO₂ measured globally, with unmanaged ecosystems like tropical forests acting as
            carbon sinks.<br><br>
            The study underscores the need to monitor CO₂ emissions from deforestation and reforestation efforts,
            providing insights on how land management impacts the carbon balance.<br><br>
            An international team, including NASA scientists, used commercial satellite images to map nearly 10 billion
            individual trees in Africa's drylands, providing the first comprehensive estimate of tree carbon density in
            the Saharan, Sahel, and Sudanian regions. The research found more trees in these semi-arid regions than
            previously estimated, but they store less carbon than some earlier models suggested.<br><br>
            The study estimated that about 0.84 petagrams (1 billion metric tons) of carbon are stored in African
            drylands, which is lower than some previous models predicted. Measurements of tree crown area were used to
            estimate the carbon stored in each tree.

        <h2>Afrotropic Region's CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</h2>
        <div class="data-point">
            This study finds that tropical Africa acts as a net emitter of CO<sub>2</sub> in the dry season, when practices
            including biomass burning reach a peak, and a net sink in the wet season, when plants grow faster and use
            more CO<sub>2</sub>. Thus tropical Africa's land can be considered “neutral” in terms of its CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.
        </div>
        <div class="data-point">
            The 2019 study in Nature Communications analysed annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from tropical Africa using data from
            Japan's Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) and NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2). The
            study found that net CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from Africa's tropical land — the difference between the amount of CO<sub>2</sub>
            absorbed and emitted — amounted to 5.4 billion tonnes in 2015 and 6 billion tonnes in 2016.
        </div>
        <div class="data-point">
            Africa is vulnerable to climate change but emits a small portion of GHGs. Additionally, decarbonization
            might cause reductions in cooling aerosols, which offsets temperature benefits from CO<sub>2</sub> reductions. However,
            climate change impacts weather conditions other than temperature. Using the NASA Goddard Institute for Space
            Studies climate model, we find that although African emissions cuts have weak impacts on projected African
            temperatures, they significantly impact rainfall. Although the increasing emissions lead to substantial
            drying over Northern Africa during local summer, that drying can be eliminated using a sustainable
            development pathway. The reduction in cooling aerosols causes ~33-90% of the avoided drying in our model,
            with the remainder largely attributable to reduced absorbing aerosols. African policy choices may greatly
            reduce regional African summer drying, giving parts of Africa substantial leverage over their own climate
            and air quality future.

            Launched in 2014, the OCO-2 satellite maps carbon dioxide concentrations with the help of three camera-like
            spectrometers. These devices are tuned to detect the unique spectra, or light signature, of carbon dioxide.
            They measure the gas indirectly by how much reflected sunlight it absorbs in a given column of air.

        <h2>Effects of Climate Change in the Afrotropic Region</h2>
        <p>The global average surface temperatures in 2020 were the highest on record, tied with 2016. This significant
            increase in temperatures in Africa may exacerbate droughts, affect water resources, and threaten
            agricultural production.<br><br>
            The 2022 heatwaves contributed to severe conditions, with Uganda's drought-induced famine causing 2,465
            deaths, marking it as one of the deadliest events that year. These disasters highlight the urgent need for
            climate resilience strategies in African nations, which face challenges due to inadequate climate-friendly
            planning.<br><br>
            Sea-level increase reached 5 mm per year in several oceanic areas surrounding the continent and exceeded 5
            mm per year in the south-western Indian Ocean. This is more than the average global sea-level rise of 3~4 mm
            per year.<br><br>
            Africa is responsible for less than 10 percent of GHG emissions. But it is the continent which faces the
            worst of the negative impacts of climate change. Heatwaves, heavy rains, floods, tropical cyclones, and
            prolonged droughts have devastating impacts on communities and economies, increasing numbers of people at
            risk.
