    <h2>Species Affected</h2>
        <div class="data-point">
            The Himalayan Quail has not been seen in 150 years, likely due to habitat changes caused by climate and human activities. The Namdapha Flying Squirrel, is at risk from habitat destruction in Arunachal Pradesh. The Leith's Softshell Turtle has suffered a 90% population decline due to exploitation and habitat loss, while the  Andaman's White-toothed Shrew and Jenkins's Shrew are vulnerable due to limited habitats and past disasters.

        <h2>Carbon Dioxide Emissions</h2>
        <p>Deforestation is the major source of greenhouse gases. In Indonesia and Malaysia, home to the world's largest
            forestlands, trees are cut down to make way for farms to feed growing populations and for the production of
            pulp and paper and palm oil, which are big sources of export revenue. Deforestation accounts for almost half
            of Indonesia's emissionsâ€”more than fossil fuels, though these are fast catching up.</p>

        <h2>Attempts to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions</h2>
        <div class="data-point">
            Between 2000 and 2020, Southeast Asia experienced a substantial increase in total primary energy supply,
            driven primarily by Indonesia and Vietnam, which have emerged as key contributors to the region's carbon
            dioxide (CO2) emissions. The energy supply composition revealed a heavy reliance on fossil fuels,
            particularly coal and natural gas, while traditional biomass maintained significance, especially in rural
            areas of Myanmar and Cambodia. Although there was a gradual shift toward renewable energy sources during
            this period, their overall contribution remained minimal compared to fossil fuels. This trend highlights the
            urgent need for Southeast Asian countries to accelerate their transition to cleaner energy alternatives and
            enhance regional collaboration to implement sustainable energy solutions, ultimately aiming to reduce CO2
            emissions and combat climate change. These sources of energy may not have any immediate impact on the levels
            of Carbon dioxide, yet this change to renewable sources of energy is pivotal to reduce the global
            temperature in the long run. [Source: IEA]

        <div class="data-point">
            Over China, the United States, and South Asia, the majority of emissions came from power plants, industrial
            facilities, and cars and trucks. For example, per-capita emissions will be higher in economies that rely
            more on carbon-intensive modes of transportation (like driving and flying), have a higher share of
            energy-intensive industries (like steel or chemicals) or depend heavily on fossil fuels for power
            generation.

        <div class="data-point">
            Migrants from rural areas flock to cities, which emit more heat. New construction in floodplains blocks
            waterways, leaving cities more vulnerable to floods. And the more cities grow, the greater the damage from
            increasingly frequent floods and storms. Indonesia has one of the world's longest coastlines at 54,700
            kilometres. In the Philippines, which has 36,300 kilometres of coastline, 20 typhoons on average make
            landfall yearly, with increasing destructiveness.
            ASEAN leaders aim for a 23 percent share of renewables in the region's energy mix by 2025, up from 10
            percent in 2015.

        <h2>Major Effects</h2>
        <div class="data-point">
            In November, the water level at the Blue Dragon rose to 1.6 meters (5.25 feet) due to typhoon-driven rains.
            Typhoons and floods in Vietnam and Southeast Asia are becoming more intense and frequent due to climate
            change. Long coastlines and heavily populated low-lying areas make the region of more than 640 million
            people one of the world's most vulnerable to weather extremes and rising sea levels associated with global
            warming.
        </div>
        <div class="data-point">
            Vietnam, Myanmar, the Philippines, and Thailand are among the 10 countries most affected by climate change
            in the past 20 years, according to the Global Climate Risk Index.
            The World Bank lists Vietnam among five countries likely to be significantly affected by global warming in
            the future.

        <div class="data-point">
            The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates Southeast Asia could suffer bigger losses than most regions in
            the world. Unchecked, climate change could shave 11 percent off the region's GDP by the end of the century
            as it takes a toll on key sectors such as agriculture, tourism, and fishing.

            Draining peat swamps releases thousands of tons of carbon dioxide trapped in each hectare of soil. The
            problem is compounded when farmers burn the dry peat, releasing the gas more quickly. Smoke from such fires
            has repeatedly choked neighbouring Singapore and Malaysia since 1997; emissions from the most recent
            incident in 2015 exceeded those of the entire European Union, according to Reuters.
