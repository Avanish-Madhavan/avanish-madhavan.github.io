    <h2>Species Affected</h2>
        <div class="data-point">
            Coral reefs, essential for many marine species, are also under threat from ocean acidification and temperature rise, jeopardizing species such as sharks and rays. The Partula snail, once abundant in Polynesia, is now critically endangered due to habitat loss and climate impacts.

        <h2>Carbon dioxide Emissions:</h2>
        <div class="data-point">
            In the larger economies of Oceania, private car use has continued to dominate passenger transport, even
            though the region has good access to public transport. In Australia, around 87% of work commutes in 2021
            were by drivers or passengers of a car, motorcycle, or truck, while only 5% were by walking or cycling and
            7% by public transport. Small-island countries have experienced rapid growth in motorisation (covering
            four-wheeled motor vehicles) as economies grow and urbanise. During 2010-2019, the region's largest growth
            was in Fiji and the Federated States of Micronesia, with increases near or above 40%. Australia and New
            Zealand had the highest overall motorisation levels in the region as of 2020.
        </div>
        <div class="data-point">
            Oceania remained the lowest emitter of transport carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions (excluding international
            aviation and shipping) among world regions in 2021, contributing less than 2% of transport emissions
            globally. Australia continued to be the largest emitter of transport CO<sub>2</sub> in the region and the 17th largest
            emitter globally in 2021, but it was surpassed by Cook Islands in emissions per capita.
        </div>
        <div class="data-point">
            Due to its immense size, the ocean's carbon reservoir is roughly 20 times larger than the combined
            atmosphere and land reservoirs. The eventual fate of our atmospheric carbon emissions will be primarily in
            the oceans, as the ocean has absorbed roughly 40% of fossil fuel carbon dioxide (CO₂) since the beginning of
            the industrial era. How do we understand the details of how the ocean takes up carbon? It isn't easy — the
            ocean is vast, deep, and continually in motion. Even with ocean-observing satellites that orbit Earth 24/7,
            data from below the ocean surface is sparse. Data-driven estimates of how much carbon dioxide the ocean is
            absorbing (the so-called “ocean carbon sink”) have improved substantially in recent years. However,
            computational ocean models that include biogeochemistry continue to play a critical role as they allow us to
            fill critical gaps in data and understand the individual processes that control ocean carbon storage.
        </div>
        <div class="data-point">
            While the physical oceanographic community has made great progress in developing data assimilation systems,
            for example, the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) consortium, the biogeochemical
            community has generally lagged behind. The ECCO-Darwin model represents an important technological step
            forward as it is the first global ocean biogeochemistry model that <b><br><br>(1) ingests both physical and
            biogeochemical observations into the model in a realistic manner and<br> (2) considers how the nature of the
            ocean carbon sink has changed over multiple decades. <br><br></b>As the ECCO ocean circulation estimates become more
            accurate and lengthen in time, ECCO-Darwin will become an ever more accurate and useful tool for
            climate-related ocean carbon cycle and mitigation studies.

        <div class="data-point">
            NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) and OCO-3 missions are instrumental in tracking global CO<sub>2</sub>
            emissions from space. These missions have enabled precise measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide,
            helping researchers monitor carbon fluxes and better understand how different ecosystems respond to climate
            changes. For instance, recent studies using OCO-2 data revealed that semi-arid regions in Australia release
            pulses of CO<sub>2</sub> after rainfall, and the Congo Basin rainforest is a net carbon source during its dry season
            due to agricultural fires. Additionally, OCO-2 data have been incorporated into the Global Stocktake, an
            international effort to assess progress toward climate goals under the Paris Agreement.

        <h2>Effects of Climate Change in Oceania:</h2>
        <div class="data-point">
            Diatoms, the largest type of phytoplankton algae, have declined more than 1 percent per year from 1998 to
            2012 globally, with significant losses occurring in the North Pacific, North Indian and Equatorial Indian
            oceans. The reduction in population may reduce the amount of carbon dioxide drawn out of the atmosphere and
            transferred to the deep ocean for long-term storage.
        </div>
        <div class="data-point">
            "Phytoplankton need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis, just like trees," said oceanographer and lead author
            Cecile Rousseaux, of Universities Space Research Association and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in
            Greenbelt, Maryland. CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere dissolves in cold ocean water. During a phytoplankton bloom,
            which can span hundreds of miles and be seen from space, the tiny organisms take up the dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> and
            convert it to organic carbon
        </div>
        <div class="data-point">
            While plankton flourish in this rich, cold water, they can't fully use available nutrients and the dissolved
            inorganic carbon.The unused nutrients are subsequently transported toward the equator via large-scale ocean
            circulation, fueling a large fraction of the biological production in the subtropics and tropics.
        </div>
        <div class="data-point">
            This loss of phytoplankton is extremely harmful because Phytoplankton lie at the base of the food chain. A
            large loss in the number of phytoplankton will eventually lead to loss of all other forms of marine life as
            we move up the food chain due to lack of prey. The seasonal pattern of carbon cycling in the Southern Ocean
            is also shaped by the slowdown in phytoplankton growth during the winter.
